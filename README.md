# PyNumberGuessingGame

By: Sohan Kyatham

This is the code for Number Guessing Game. The Number Guessing Game is a guessing game with a graphical user interface (GUI) that is was created with Python Tkinter. The user has to click the generate number button, and the random module will select a random number. Then the user has to input guesses in the entry box. If the user guesses too high, then there will be a result label that tells the user they guessed too high and they need to guess lower. If the user guesses too low, then there will be a result label that tells the user they guessed too low and they need to guess higher. If the user guessed correctly, then the result label will say the user guessed correctly.
